# Unity Scene Bridge

A simple additive scene loading system with a built-in loading screen workflow.

Loads scenes asynchronously in the background, keeps them inactive until fully ready, displays a loading canvas during the transition, and then cleanly activates the new scene while unloading the old one. Designed to provide smooth, controlled scene transitions with minimal setup.
